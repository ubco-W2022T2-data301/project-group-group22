Ricky: I am interested in this dataset because I am a fan of hockey and like to see the statistical aspects of players' performances. I would like to find if there is a corelation between drops and increases in certain statistics for consecutive years for the top NHL players in points. Specific examples of research questions I would like to discover answers to are: Does an increase/decrease in time on ice per game relate to an increase in certain stats like overall points in the season? Do the top players that have a decrease in their offensive stats in a succesive season make up for it with an increase in their defensive stats? How many of the top 250 players in points from the 2017-2018 season managed to make the top 350 players in points for the 2018-2019 season? How many of those players didn't make the top 350 just because they retired?

Renat: I find the topic of analysing NHL player performance of personal interest, as I am a big fan of hockey. I used to play thee sport as a kid, and watch NHL games. The analysis of players' statistical data in one year and evaluation the correlation between their performance of the following year seems like it would bring further understanding of hockey, and I am excited to see what the results will show. For the data set, we used a website that provides royalty-free NHL statistics under Open License. After performing some edits on the data by using a Python code which removes colums in the statistics which are not of interest, as well as players' data entries which are not in both the 2017 and 2018 data sets, we got usable data of player's performance in 2017, and the following season. I am interested to see how each performance statstic of 2017 affects the player's goals scored and the ranking in 2018, and whether one has a larger effect than the others.
