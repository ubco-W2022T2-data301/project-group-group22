# Project Vision

We aspire to compare the statistics of top hockey players to uncover correlations in their performance between seasons. As a team, we will create a dashboard that displays these relations in an intuitive and easy to understand format. By the end of the semester, we will share the trends in player performance with our peers with the goal of inspiring the same interest in hockey and data analysis that motivates our team.
